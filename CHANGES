Harold Gimenez and Mike Burns:

Initial release with support to various index types:

* Partial indexes
* Expression indexes
* Sorted indexes
* Building indexes concurrently: Since AR migrations are wrapped in a transaction, and concurrent index building cannot be in a transaction, we commit the transaction, issue the CREATE INDEX statement, and start a new transaction afterwards.
